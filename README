premailer-rails
=========

This plugin allows you to write HTML emails properly (i.e. using proper CSS) and uses Alex Dunae's premailer to convert the emails to inlined HTML suitable for all major email clients.


Example
=======

in RAILS_ROOT/app/models/notifications.rb:

	def some_mail(args)
		subject    args.delete(:subject)
		recipients args.delete(:recipient)
		from       args.delete(:from)
		sent_on    Time.now
		
		body       args
		
		premail
	end

This mail can now be written a standard HTML document using CSS linked in, using partials etc (as in any other view on your site). It should be at app/views/notifications/some_mail.text.html.erb. 

Premailer will then prepare an inlined version of the view whenever a email is sent.
